# Science Island Planning

This is a living document hub for the Planning Phase of Science Island. Its purpose is to field and review propositions for the development of Science Island, and, once propositions have been discussed and approved, to record them for reference during the Development Phase.

## Mission

Science Island is a hypothetical space envisioned by the GT SPS Alumni and friends, and its purpose is to facilitate future cooperative ventures by way of providing some combination of residential capacities, design and manufacturing capabilities, computational resources, and capacity for other facilities, equipment, and processes requested by members.
